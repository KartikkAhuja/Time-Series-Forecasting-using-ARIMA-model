# Time-Series-Forecasting-using-ARIMA-model
Utilized libraries like yfinance,numpy,pandas,matplotlib to extract and visualize data

Explored characteristics such as seasonality,stationarity and splitted dataset into training and testing data

Conducted analysis of autocorrelation function(ACF) and partial autocorrelation function(PACF) and unit root test to select
the parameters(p,d,q) used in ARIMA model

Evaluated the performance of the ARIMA model with the predicted price
